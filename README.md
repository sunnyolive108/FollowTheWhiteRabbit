# RabbitMQ Message Processing Program

This program fetches messages from a RabbitMQ queue and processes them, writing the results into a file.

## Features

- Fetch messages from a RabbitMQ queue
- Process messages using the `interpret_json` function (more to come)
- Write processed data into a file

## Future Ideas

- Further automate the handling process
- Additional processing of data into another program
- Feed data into a statistics & documentation program
- Create an interface to input host and port information

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunnyolive108/jsonfromrabbits.git
2. Set up a RabbitMQ and host it
3. Run the program
   ```bash
   python jsonfromrabbits.py
